# Candidate Application Platform

## Overview

This repository contains the codebase for a candidate application platform. The platform allows users to view job listings, filter jobs based on various criteria, and implement infinite scroll for a seamless browsing experience. The platform provides a user-friendly interface for viewing and applying for jobs.

Each job listing is displayed as a card containing the following information:

- Experience required
- Apply button/link

#### Filters

Filters are implemented to allow users to refine job listings based on the following criteria:
- Minimum experience
- Company name
- Location
- Remote/on-site
- Tech stack
- Role
- Minimum base pay

#### Infinite Scroll

Infinite scroll is implemented to load additional job listings as the user scrolls down the page. The platform fetches and displays more jobs automatically without requiring the user to click on a "Load More" button.
